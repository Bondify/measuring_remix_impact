11/6/2019,Chris's map export show,"GoRaleigh (Raleigh, NC)","Good morning! I used this application this week to create a couple of maps. I usually have to go to my planning team with GIS experience to get maps. I made 3 new maps, entered them into a PPT and gave a presentation to one of our board committees. During the meeting my staff were all shocked and asking amongst themselves who made the maps (I am not very technology savvy). It was quick and easy. I think it is a great addition to the Remix platform. In addition to the fact that I created the maps myself, my staff were impressed with the map product and plan to use it as we move forward as long as it remains available. My only suggestion would be to add a legend box so that we can label the different maps on the downloaded image. I couldn?t find any way to do that within the software. Thanks and have a fantastic day!",,Kyle Boehm,Decision-maker Communication,Predominately agency centric,A few people / tiny agency

5/16/2019,COA Communication,"COAST (Dover, NH)","COAST (Dover, NH) is currently doing a COA inside of Remix. New Hampshire provides no state funding for transit service, so COAST has to build a collation of cities, towns, and local businesses to fund their service. They use Remix both online and in-person to communicate service changes with their partners and explain the effects of the changes. The process was extremely difficult when they planned on paper, but now they can just send a link or pull up a map during a meeting. Remix makes it easier to build consensus on COAST's proposed changes and therefore makes it easier for them to raise funds from their partners","""Everyone in New Hampshire in jealous that we have Remix"" ""This saves us a ton in consulting fees""",Isaac Shapiro,Decision-maker Communication,Equal community and agency impact Community centric with some agency impact,City or system level impact

5/2/2019,N Judah Shut Down Savings,"SFMTA (San Francisco, CA)","<p>From Tiffany - *Belated SFMTA win share.* Ran into Julie Kirschbaum (new head of transit) waiting for the 14R - she said &quot;we&#39;ve been using Remix way more than we thought we would.&quot; (that is a compliment from julie if i&#39;ve ever heard one.) Specifically, they used Remix to plan the N Judah Bus Substitution last month, and found a way to save 40% on operating costs by running the shuttles to Carl+Cole instead of all the way to Duboce which is what they thought they would do. https://www.sfmta.com/blog/n-judah-bus-substitution</p>","We've been using Remix way more than we though we would.

3/7/2019,NeMo provider geofences using KMLs generated with Transit,"LADOT (Los Angeles, CA)","Quite fascinating how *Vlad from LADOT uses Remix Transit to create all sorts of shapefiles he needs done for non-Transit use cases*. Here, to draw the CicLAvia event shapefile, he created 5 Transit maps, exported them in KML, and composed one final geojson that LA sent to Scooter Providers for them to geofence the area during the event. Why not Esri you might ask? Remix is easier to use and more precise for this because it does street snapping and he gets a clean shapefile with a well defined centerline! https://lahub.maps.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=0a8cd03764724d74837f467aff64017e&sortOrder=true&sortField=defaultFSOrder#data https://remix123.slack.com/archives/C1GVDJ5SP/p1551984436004200",,Amanjeet Ahdi,Internal Communication,Agency centric with some external impact,Large dep. colab / multiple agencies / a big community
